# Salah_Tracker 

## Project Overview:
Salah is ritual prayer a Muslim observes five times a day. It is one of the pillar of Islam that
is mandatory for a Muslim. The quality of Salah holds a great importance in terms of oneâ€™s
intentions and the way he performs all the acts. Each prayer consists of two, three or four
rounds (Rakkah), depending on the time of the day and each Rakkah consists of certain
stages that needs to be completed.
In daily life while offering Salah, people often face problems in remembering the Rakkah
they were performing and as a result they have to offer the Salah all over again. This
problem is mostly faced by people suffering from dementia, elderly people, newly
converted muslims or the general people. In addition to this, some people are interested
in keeping track of the quality of their Salah in terms of completeness and order of their
prayer, as well as keep a track of the Salah they have performed all day long.

## Proposed Solution
Our proposed solution for the project is to develop a mobile based application that will
monitor the activities of a muslim in each Rakkah using sensors of a smart watch. It will
inform the user about the time spent on each activity during each Rakkah and if each
activity was performed correctly during Salah. The user would be informed about the
average time spent on each Rakkah and if he has missed any Rakkah. In addition, along
with the Salah timings, user would be informed about the prayers performed all day.
